    > TITLE
        >> Bold-italics Combo

    > PURPOSE
        >> Used to make text entity bold as well as italics simultaneously.

    > THEORY
        >> The text can be made in bold-italics form in two ways:
            >>> Triple star enclosing method
            >>> Triple underscore enclosing method

        >> The combination of star and underscore won't work. You got to either use star or underscore for each entity.

Whenever you feel like a ***failure,*** always remember that you have already ___won a race against millions___ during time of your creation, and with almost no self-conciousness!
