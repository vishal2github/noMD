    > TITLE
        >> Bold

    > PURPOSE
        >> Used to make text entity bold.

    > THEORY
        >> The text can be made in bold form in two ways:
            >>> Double star enclosing method
            >>> Double underscore enclosing method

        >> The combination of star and underscore won't work. You got to either use star or underscore for each entity.
