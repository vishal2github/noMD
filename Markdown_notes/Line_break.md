        >> Line break/New line

    > PURPOSE
        >> To create a new line or to shift an entity from the new line.

    > THEORY
        >> One can use the line break or new line via two different methods:
            >>> Double Spacing Method
            >>> <br> tag Method

        >> In double spacing method, any text entity with two space after it will create a newline or line break, provided that there shouldn't be anything written after the two spaces.

        >> Using 'br' tag of html will also work and provide a line break.
