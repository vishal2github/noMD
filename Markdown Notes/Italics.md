    > TITLE
        >> Italics

    > PURPOSE
        >> Used to make text entity inclined.

    > THEORY
        >> The text can be made in italics form in two ways:
            >>> Single star enclosing method
            >>> Single underscore enclosing method
        
        >> The combination of star and underscore won't work. You got to either use star or underscore for each entity.

*This is the example-statement 1 in the italics form, using single star enclosure.*  
_This is the example-statement 2 in the italics form, using single underscore enclosure._

With great *responsiblity*, comes great _personality!_
