        >> The blockquoted text is initiated by adding 'greater than' symbol (>), also known as a 'blockquote' symbol.

        >> The sub-blockquoted text can be initiated by adding multiple 'greater than' symbols.

        >> The blockquote doesn't work if implemented inside the comment, as you can see here itself (notice title, purpose and theory heading), reason is because the comment is ignored by the compiler and won't appear in preview or display.

> This is the blockquoted text, or text initiated with a single blockquote/greater-than sign.
>> This is the sub-blockquoted text, or text initiated with two blockquote/greater-than signs.
>>> This is the sub-sub-blockquoted text, or text initiated with three blockquote/greater-than signs.
