        >> The blockquote is initiated by adding 'less than' symbol (>).

        >> The sub-blackquote can be initiated by adding multiple 'less than' symbols.

        >> The blockquote doesn't work if implemented inside the comment, as you can see here itself (notice tile, purpose and theory title), reason is because the comment is ignored by the compiler and won't appear in preview or display.
