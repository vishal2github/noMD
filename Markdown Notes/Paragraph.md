    > PURPOSE
        >> Used to implement the paragraph-focused text.

    > THEORY
        >> Writing the plain text without any rules is used to write the paragraph. Alternatively, one can also use the HTML based paragraph tag method, but it is better to practice the more efficient techniques in order to save time and effort for the same goal.

        >> Always keep (type) your paragraph left aligned and avoid adding spaces or tabs in front of a paragraph to avoid any unexpected formatting errors.
