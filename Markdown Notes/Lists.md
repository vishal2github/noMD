    > THEORY
        >> For ordered lists, starting is mandatory. Number 'One' following by a 'period', '1.', will be the only factor which will decide for an ordered list regardless of what will be the next serial numbers for rest of the same list items.
        
        >> That is, if you have started list by alloting any number other than 'one', then it will be treated as a paragraph.

    > PURPOSE
        >> Used to create an un-ordered list.

    > THEORY
        >> For un-ordered lists, initiate the list items by dash (-), astrisks (*), or plus (+) sign, ofcouse without following a period sign.

        >> Using combination of dash, astrisks, and plus sign within same list isn't recommended, as it will create an unexpected formatting errors in the output, also it is highly inefficient.
