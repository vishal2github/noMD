    > PURPOSE
        >> Used for the headlines and titles of any article.

    > THEORY
        >> Headings can be implemented in the two ways:
            >>> Markdown based method (recommended for MD)
            >>> HTML based method (alternate for MD)

        >> Although one can use the HTML method for defining the headings, but why to complicate things if the markdown has its own set of rules which are more simple than the HTML.
        
        >> Consider '#' and "<h1></h1>" for defining a heading, now what do you think is more efficient to use for the same goal.

        >> The heading(s) is practically-represented via hash symbol (#), before the starting of any entity.

        >> The headings are ranged in the six different sizes, i.e., from single hash to six hashes constantly. The more the number of hashes, the smaller will be the size of heading.

        >> As in perspective of visual clarity for the code reading purpose, try to add spaces above and below of heading as well.
            >>> # Example-Headline

                This is statement one space after the heading (RECOMMENDED)
            
            >>> # Example-Headline
                This is statement just after the heading (NOT SO RECOMMENDED)
